    Fetch queries may be paginated if the total result size is expected to be large
    (e.g. project_logs which accumulate over a long time). Note that fetch queries
    only support pagination in descending time order (from latest to earliest
    `_xact_id`. Furthermore, later pages may return rows which showed up in earlier
    pages, except with an earlier `_xact_id`. This happens because pagination occurs
    over the whole version history of the event log. You will most likely want to
    exclude any such duplicate, outdated rows (by `id`) from your combined result
    set.

    The `limit` parameter controls the number of full traces to return. So you may
    end up with more individual rows than the specified limit if you are fetching
    events containing traces.

    Together, `max_xact_id` and `max_root_span_id` form a cursor for paginating
    event fetches. Given a previous fetch with a list of rows, you can determine
    `max_root_span_id` as the maximum of the `root_span_id` field over all rows. See
    the documentation for `limit` for an overview of paginating fetch queries.
